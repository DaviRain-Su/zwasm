# Skip — `externref-segment.0.wasm` (externref element segment)

- **Status**: Closed/Superseded (2026-06-13) — externref reftype landed in a later phase; the fixture now PASSES end-to-end as a plain `module` directive (the D-290 wasm-tools regen dropped the skip-line, and the runtime gate reports `externref-segment.0.wasm` PASS). The "Removal plan" / machine-checkable "Removal condition" below is satisfied; this ADR stays as historical record. The prior "Accepted (skip until externref reftype lands)" status is retained for context below.

## Fixture

- `test/wasmtime_misc/wast/reftypes/externref-segment/externref-segment.0.wasm`

The fixture declares an `externref` table + an `(elem ... externref)`
segment with `ref.null extern` initializers, then exports a getter
that observes `is_null(ref)` for both segment-initialised slots
and post-`table.fill` slots.

## What v2 does today

`zig build test-wasmtime-misc-runtime` reports the fixture as
`InstanceAllocFailed` because the validator/lowerer pipeline does
not yet accept `externref` as a `RefType`. zwasm's element-segment
work landed in 6.K.4 was scoped to `funcref` only.

## Why v2 declines

Per **ADR-0014 §2.1 / 6.K.4 (Element-section forms 5 / 6 / 7)**
the funcref-only scope was an explicit decision: each non-funcref
reftype (`externref` and forthcoming GC-proposal reftypes) lands
as its own ROADMAP row, not as part of a single "wasm 2.0 reftypes"
sweep. Stretching 6.K.4 to externref would have leaked into
`Value.ref`'s storage layout (host-pointer slot + tag bit) and
into the global / table import paths the same row touches — an
unnecessary scope expansion for a row that already covered three
distinct element forms.

## What v2 needs to fix this honestly

A new ROADMAP row (likely `§9.<N> / E.X — externref reftype + host
ref API`) implementing:

1. `Value.ref_extern` storage encoding (host *anyopaque* pointer
   slot, distinct from `*FuncEntity`, with one tag bit).
2. Validator: accept `externref` as a `RefType`; type-check
   `ref.null extern`, `ref.is_null`, `ref.func` -> externref
   coercion is not allowed.
3. Lowerer: ZIR ops for `externref` table init / fill / get / set.
4. Runtime: `TableInstance` accepts mixed reftype; `table.fill`
   on externref tables.
5. C-ABI: extend `wasm_ref_t` host opaque ref handle alongside
   `wasm_funcref_t`.

This is on the Phase 6/7 spec-conformance backlog, not 6.K's
ownership-model scope.

## Removal plan

When the externref reftype row lands and externref-segment.0.wasm
passes end-to-end, remove this skip-ADR's fixture from the
deferred-skip list. The ADR itself stays as historical record.

## Removal condition (machine-checkable)

> `externref-segment.0.wasm` reports PASS in
> `zig build test-wasmtime-misc-runtime`.

## Current effectiveness gap (2026-05-11)

Per the 2026-05-11 ADR audit
(`private/20250511_adr_audit/SUMMARY.md` §2.1 +
`batch_A_findings.md`), this skip-ADR is **not effective** per
ADR-0050 D-2's three-path test:

- **Path 1 (runner-side classification)**: ❌ no
  `skip-adr` token recognition in `wast_runtime_runner.zig`.
- **Path 2 (DEFER mark + runner skip-token)**: ❌ the
  fixture appears in `manifest_runtime.txt` as plain `module
  externref-segment.0.wasm` without `# DEFER:` mark.
- **Path 3 (manifest exclusion)**: ❌ fixture is active in
  the manifest.

Operational effect: `zig build test-wasmtime-misc-runtime`
reports `FAIL externref-segment/externref-segment.0.wasm:
instantiate InstanceAllocFailed`. Same masking as
`skip_embenchen_emcc_env_imports.md` — `test-wasmtime-misc-
runtime` is not in `test-all`.

Discharge tracked as **D-072** alongside the embenchen
skip-ADR. The structural fix (externref reftype landing per
"What v2 needs to fix this honestly") naturally retires this
skip-ADR.

## Implementation (per ADR-0029 Path B, since chunk 9.9-h-23)

The fixture's `manifest_runtime.txt` carries the line
`skip-adr-skip_externref_segment externref-segment.0.wasm`
in place of `module externref-segment.0.wasm`. Parsed by
`test/runners/wast_runtime_runner.zig` (since chunk 9.9-h-23);
the runner emits the line in the `skip-adr` tally rather than
`skip-impl`, contributing to the
`266 passed, 0 failed, 5 skipped (= 0 skip-impl + 5 skip-adr)`
tally on `zig build test-wasmtime-misc-runtime` — operationally
effective per ADR-0050 D-2. The "Current effectiveness gap
(2026-05-11)" §below predates the migration and is retained for
historical context.
