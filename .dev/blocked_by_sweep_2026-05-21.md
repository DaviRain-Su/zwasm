# Blocked-by ledger sweep — 2026-05-21

> **Doc-state**: ACTIVE — load-bearing reference (Phase 9+ scope).

> Initial sweep per close-plan §6 (h) acceptance. Establishes
> the age-threshold ladder defined in
> [`audit_scaffolding §F.2a`](../.claude/skills/audit_scaffolding/CHECKS.md)
> and classifies the 28 active `blocked-by` rows in
> [`.dev/debt.md`](debt.md) at sweep time.

## Threshold ladder (re-state)

| Age (today − Last reviewed)              | Finding | Action                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ≤ 14 calendar days (≈ ≤ 3 resume cycles) | clean   | No action.                                                                          |
| 15–30 days (> 3 cycles)                  | `soon`  | Re-walk the barrier; update `Last reviewed` if still blocked.                       |
| > 30 days (> 5 cycles)                   | `block` | File an ADR or lesson capturing the structural cause, OR promote the row to `now`.  |

### `block` (> 30 days; needs ADR/lesson OR promote) — 0 rows

None. The oldest entry is 17 days; no row has fossilised past
the 30-day threshold.

## Action plan

This sweep document is the static snapshot. The 7 `soon` rows
each need a barrier re-walk; that work is captured as **D-156**
in `.dev/debt.md` (added in the same commit as this sweep). The
re-walk happens in subsequent `/continue` cycles, one row at a
time, per the Step 0.5 unconditional check.

Once D-156 closes, the next periodic sweep can re-run this
file's classification logic via the planned
`scripts/audit_blocked_by_age.sh` (filed under D-155 follow-up
to ADR-0078 + audit §F.2a; same script can serve both
audit-skill checks).

## Notes

- D-070 was incorrectly returned by an early `awk` pass; it is
  in the "Recently discharged" section, not active. Excluded.
- "≈ 3 resume cycles = 14 days" calibrates the conversion based
  on the 2026-05-04 → 2026-05-21 timeframe seeing roughly 4
  active `/continue` loops; the calendar threshold remains
  authoritative when the cycle count is ambiguous.
